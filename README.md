Eye-Controlled Mouse Using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI

Project Overview
This project demonstrates a hands-free mouse control system that tracks eye movements to control the cursor and detects blinks to simulate mouse clicks. Built with OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI, this system is ideal for accessibility purposes, allowing users with physical limitations to control their computers with ease.

Features
Real-time Cursor Control: Tracks eye movement to move the mouse cursor.
Click Detection: Detects blinks to perform mouse clicks.
Accessible & Adaptive: Suitable for users seeking an alternative to traditional input devices.
